Oracle Identity Management API's Java API Reference for Oracle Identity Manager 11GR2PS2
Oracle provides a network-aware, Java-based application programming interface (API) that exposes Services, called Utility in earlier releases, available in Oracle Identity Manager. This API is based on Plain Old Java Objects (POJO) and takes care of all the plumbing required to interact with Oracle Identity Manager. This API can be used for building clients for Oracle Identity Manager and for integrating third-party products with the Oracle Identity Manager platform.
